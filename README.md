## Section 3 - Procedural Worlds - Lecture List

In this section we will use the power of mathematics to drive our environment starting with generated textures Section Reference: PW_BEC

### 1 Procedural Worlds Introduction

Michael welcomes you to the new section.

### 2 Checking For Updates To Blender

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Check if there are any changes to 2.8
2. Understand limitation or version changes and update

**After watching (learning outcomes)…**


Understand the issues you may run into when updating Blender

### 3 Generated Textures Are Different

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Not bound by resolution
2. Easy to have values higher than 1 and less than 0
3. Baking them out will return you to those downsides


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Understand the fundamental differences between baked textures and generated

### 4 Real Displacement Using Textures

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Explore in detail the displacement modifier.
2. No Current way of passing through our previously generated textures.
3. Must have geometry in order to function


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will have a much great understanding of the displacement modifier and how to use it.

### 5 Displacement Texture Coordinates

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. What all of the Texture Coordinate options mean
2. This is wider than just the displacement modifier


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will understand texture coordinates and how and when to use them.


### 6 Displacement Quick Tip- Transforms

Michael explains the importance of applying transforms with the displacement modifier.

### 7 Procedural Study Spheres

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Using some basic spheres
2. Build up a small collection of studies
3. Use a mixture of generated and baked textures


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Have a better understanding of what the generated textures look like.


### 8 Layering Displacements

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Use The displacement Modifier Several Times to make an interesting object
2. Understand the Order Of modifiers
3. Create a detailed object with no modeling


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will be able to make more complex and detailed procedural models.

### 9 Vertex Groups

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Create a Vertex group
2. Use the vertex group to control where displacement occurs


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will be able to customise and be specific on how modifiers affect your model

### 10 Weight Painting

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Look at an alternative way of assigning vertex groups
2. Understand the brush tools are the same as with texture painting


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will be able to use weight paint to control the geometry of your models


### 11 Smoothing Out Details

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Remove jagged edges without adding more geometry
2. Fix holes in geometry caused when adding modifiers


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Use the smooth modifier to lessen jagged geometry without resorting to increase geometry



### 12 Empties And Their Uses

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Add Empties to our scene
2. Use the Empties to Parent or objects to
3. Use Empties to Control Texture coordinates


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Create an infinite variety of object using an empty to control your texture coordinates.
