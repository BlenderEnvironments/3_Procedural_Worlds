## Section 3 - Procedural Worlds - Lecture List

In this section we will use the power of mathematics to drive our environment starting with generated textures Section Reference: PW_BEC

### 1 Procedural Worlds Introduction

Michael welcomes you to the new section.

### 2 Checking For Updates To Blender

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Check if there are any changes to 2.8
2. Understand limitation or version changes and update

**After watching (learning outcomes)…**


Understand the issues you may run into when updating Blender

### 3 Generated Textures Are Different

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Not bound by resolution
2. Easy to have values higher than 1 and less than 0
3. Baking them out will return you to those downsides


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Understand the fundamental differences between baked textures and generated

### 4 Real Displacement Using Textures

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Explore in detail the displacement modifier.
2. No Current way of passing through our previously generated textures.
3. Must have geometry in order to function


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will have a much great understanding of the displacement modifier and how to use it.

### 5 Displacement Texture Coordinates

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. What all of the Texture Coordinate options mean
2. This is wider than just the displacement modifier


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will understand texture coordinates and how and when to use them.


### 6 Displacement Quick Tip- Transforms

Michael Explains the importance of Applying transforms with the displacement modifier.
