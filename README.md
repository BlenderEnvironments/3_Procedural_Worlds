### 13 Projecting Textures

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Texture our models really quickly
2. Use project to mitigate the UV unwrap process


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Be able to use increasing complex node setups to add procedural properties to your materials

### 18 Masking With Textures

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Use a texture to say where something is and where it is not
2. Look at using is when mixing colours together or mixing shaders together
3. Generally masks are greyscale images of one value
